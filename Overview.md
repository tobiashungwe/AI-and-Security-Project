## How to Play

1. **Setup**:
   
   - Each player places their token on **Space #1 (Start)**.
   - Shuffle the **Mystery Cards** into a face-down pile.
   - Have your drinks at the ready!

2. **Turn Order**:
   
   - Decide who goes first (rock-paper-scissors, youngest, or best Santa impersonation). Play proceeds clockwise.

3. **Movement**:
   
   - On your turn, roll a six-sided die and move forward that many spaces.
   - Resolve the action on the space you land on:
     - If you land on a **Mystery Card** space, draw the top card, read it, and follow its instructions.
     - If you land on a **Mini-Game** space, follow the mini-game instructions (examples provided below), and the outcome might involve drinking.
     - If you land on **Holiday Shots!**, take one shot or sip. If you prefer, split it into multiple sips.
     - If you land on the **Candy Cane Ladder**, immediately climb up to the indicated higher space.
     - If you land on **Slippery Ice Slide**, immediately move back to the indicated lower space.
     - If you land on **“The Grinch’s Grip!”** (Space #18), you lose your next turn.
   - If you overshoot **Space #30 (Finish)**, bounce back the remainder. (E.g., if you’re on Space #28 and roll a 5, you’d land on Space #30, the leftover 3 just doesn't matter—end on 30. Alternatively, you can decide to bounce: 28 + 5 = 33 → 30 then back 3 to 27. Use whichever rule you prefer—just be consistent!)

4. **Winning**:
   
   - The first player to land exactly on (or pass) **Space #30** is declared the winner. Everyone else toasts to them in holiday spirit.
   - You can continue playing to see who comes in second, third, etc., or just celebrate the champion.

5. **Drinking Rules** (Modify as needed):
   
   - **Shots vs. Sips**: If “shot” is too strong, or if you’d like to pace yourself, take 2–3 big sips instead.
   - **Safe Word**: If someone has had enough, they can always opt out or reduce how much they drink (safety first!).

## Mystery Cards (Examples)

Print or write these on small cards. Shuffle and keep them face down. Draw whenever someone lands on a Mystery Card space. Feel free to add more or swap out ideas to match your group’s humor!

1. **“Ho Ho Ho!”**
   - Everyone wearing something red takes 1 sip. If you’re NOT wearing red, you take 2 sips.
2. **“Secret Santa Swap”**
   - Choose another player to swap positions with you on the board. Then each of you takes a sip for the spirit of giving!
3. **“Christmas Carol Challenge”**
   - Sing 5 seconds of a Christmas song. If you refuse, take 2 sips.
4. **“Naughty or Nice?”**
   - Flip a coin. Heads = you’re “nice,” give out 2 sips to someone else. Tails = you’re “naughty,” take 2 sips yourself.
5. **“Santa’s Hat”**
   - If you’re wearing any Christmas accessory (Santa hat, ugly sweater, etc.), you’re safe! Everyone else drinks 2 sips.
6. **“Mistletoe Mystery”**
   - Choose another player. Both of you drink 1 shot (or 3 sips) together. Holiday bonding!
7. **“Elf Buddy”**
   - Pick one player to be your “Elf Buddy” for the rest of the game. Whenever you drink, they drink too.
8. **“Reindeer Race”**
   - All players must pretend to gallop like reindeer around the room. Last person to do it takes 3 sips.
9. **“Frosty’s Freeze”**
   - Everyone stands up and does a freeze dance. The first to move or speak drinks 2 sips.
10. **“Snowball Fight!”**
    - Point to a player and say “Snowball!” They take 1 shot (or 2 sips). If they duck (literally duck physically!), you drink instead.
11. **“Eggnog Chug”**
    - If eggnog (or a creamy drink) is available, you must chug a small cup. If not, take 2 sips of your current drink.
12. **“Candy Cane Savor”**
    - You must hold a candy cane (or spoon, pencil, etc.) in your mouth for your next turn. If you drop it, drink 2 sips.
13. **“Jingle All The Way!”**
    - Everyone clinks glasses, says “Jingle!” and takes 1 sip. Then roll the die: if you roll a 5 or 6, you move ahead 2 spaces.
14. **“Chimney Slide”**
    - Move back 2 spaces. If this causes you to land on a Shots space, you must take the shot!
15. **“Christmas Miracle”**
    - You jump forward 3 spaces for free. If you skip over a Shots space, you’re safe—no drink required this time!

*(Feel free to repeat or customize these. Aim for ~15–20 cards total.)*

## Mini-Games (Examples)

When you land on a Mini-Game space, everyone participates, but the person who landed on it is the “host.”

1. **“Ornament Toss”**
   
   - The host grabs a small (soft) ornament or ball. Each player tries to toss it into a bowl or cup 6 feet away.
   - Everyone who **misses** drinks 1 sip. The host drinks an extra sip for each successful shot **other** people make.

2. **“Guess That Carol”**
   
   - The host hums the tune of a random Christmas song. The first person to guess correctly hands out 2 sips to any other player. If no one guesses within 15 seconds, the host drinks 3 sips.

3. **“Holiday Charades”**
   
   - The host acts out a holiday-related word/phrase (e.g., “Christmas tree,” “Santa climbing chimney,” “Snowball fight”).
   - First person to guess correctly is safe (no drink). Everyone else drinks 2 sips.

4. **“Santa’s Helpers”**
   
   - Everyone pairs up (if uneven, host can join any pair). Each pair must link arms and take a drink at the same time. The slowest pair to do so takes another sip.

5. **“Nutcracker Balance”**
   
   - The host chooses an object (like a small candy or coin) for each player to balance on their head. The first to drop it drinks 2 sips.

6. **“Ugly Sweater Runway”**
   
   - Everyone lines up to show off their holiday outfit. The host picks the “best” or “ugliest” sweater. Winner chooses someone else to drink 2 sips.

*(You can mix and match these or invent your own. Keep it quick and silly!)*

## Optional/Additional Rules

- **Team Play**: If you have a large group, form teams. Each team shares a token and decides who drinks when the space calls for it.
- **Time Limit**: Set a time limit (e.g., 60 minutes). Whoever is furthest along by the deadline wins.
- **Penalties for Cheating**: If someone cheats, calls for “no roll,” or tries to avoid a penalty, they automatically take a shot or 3 sips.

---

## Safety & Fun

- **Drink Responsibly**: Know your limits. It’s all in good fun—no one should feel pressured to overdo it.
- **Non-Alcoholic Options**: If someone wants/needs to stay sober, substitute in a fun mocktail or snack penalty instead of sips/shots.
- **Keep It Merry**: The goal is to celebrate friendship, the holidays, and good times together!

### Final Tip

Print out:

1. **The Board** (with the 30 numbered spaces and the special icons or text on each relevant tile).
2. **Mystery Cards** (shuffle them into a deck).
3. **Mini-Game reference list** (so you remember the rules).
